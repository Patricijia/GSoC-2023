      <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science graduate at the Eindhoven University of Technology, founder and mentor of the Google
        Developer Student Club at TU/e, spent my Summer
        working in the Microsoft Data Centers and analysing Chromium‚Äôs Web performance.
        Above all, I am a Web performance and tracing enthusiast.

      <h2>Improving INP Metric by Exposing InteractionId to a Wider Range of Events</h2>
      <p>
        The Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a performance metric that assesses responsiveness. It reflects how fast a
        webpage responds to user inputs. For example, when a user types a word in the textbox the INP metric measures
        speed of a response. In this case, it shows how long it took for a user to see the typed word on the screen in
        the text box.
      </p>
      <p>
        To obtain this metric we need to measure multiple components such as click or keyboard events. Although there
        might be quite a few improvements on click or continuous events in the future steps of the project this project
        mainly reflects the keyboard and composition events. The project focuses on how exposing Interaction id to
        certain
        keyboard and composition events can improve accuracy of the INP metric.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, the definition of the INP metric relies on measuring interactions. Measuring the timing of the
        interaction is achieved through the utilization of the Event Timing API. The API groups meaningful key, click
        events to compute one consistent keyboard interaction. Based on the computation it is possible to obtain several
        interaction features such as: InteractionId, processing duration and the entry type that triggered the
        interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Event Timing API enables analysis of pressing a key on a keyboard. This process entails several keyboard
        events: keydown, keypress, beforeinput, input and keyup that are fired in this specific sequence. Up until this
        point, the API exposes the interactionId feature only of the key up and key down events.
        However, measuring only keyup and keydown events might not reflect the full user experience. Keypress events can
        have the longest duration from all the events resulting in compromised accuracy of the INP metric. Hence, adding
        the interactionId to the keypress event might improve precision of the INP metric. Moreover, measuring keypress
        could possibly solve the confusion when the InteractionId is set to 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another type of interaction that can be measured with the Event Timing API is based on the composition events.
        In contrast to the keyboard interaction, the composition events are formed by inputting text in a supplementary
        or alternate manner than by Keyboard Events. However, up until now the Event Timing API exposes only the input
        event‚Äôs InteractionId during the composition. Second goal of the project is to reveal InteractionIds for
        different types of composed events such as compositionstart or compositionend.

      <h2>Make Perfetto Perfect: INP Metric</h2>

      <p>
        On Perfetto, users can get brilliant insights into the performance of applications through trace visualizations
        and metrics. Recently, core web vitals shaped a different view of a smooth website by bringing the Interaction
        to Next Paint metric to the light. Therefore, there is a need to update the Perfetto with the latest
        revolutionary metrics to provide better and faster insights to the developers of their web applications. The
        goal of this project is to improve the Perfetto tracing tool and visualize the core web vital metrics and INP in
        a consistent manner. Make Perfetto Perfect!
